# Criteria of Open Science projects

Open Science is based on following principles:    
    
**Open Data**

A way to publish the raw data where it is freely available.
    
**Open Source**

A way to give access to research prototypes. It uses open-source technology (software and hardware) and open proprietary technologies. This allows easy exchange of technical knowledge and thus ensures virtually open-technically openness.

**Open Access**

A way to make research results available by offering free open access for the material they publish, and accessible for everyone and useful. The term was coined by Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI, 2002).

**Open Methodology**

It stands for sharing the methodological details of the study provided including the tools used for data collection and analysis and it aims at bridging this gap between raw data and final results. The project should describe applying methods and the whole process should be practicable and relevant. The final publication should be understandable as possible and to make it usable for all.

**Open Peer Review**

Transparent and traceable quality assurance through open peer review.

**Open Educational Ressources**

Using free and open materials for education and in university teaching.
